# Multi_Client_Interactive_Chat
A project done as a part of the course, "Object Oriented Concepts-II(SE-306)"

This project demonstrates a simplified form of how server and clients interact with
each other.

## Flow of program : 
1. The server lets the clients connect to it
2. A client enters the chatroom
2. Client sets his username, if it is not unique then he is prompted to enter another
4. If there are other members present already, they are notified about the entrance
of a new client
5. Message sent by a client is shown to others
6. A client can leave by typing "/quit"
